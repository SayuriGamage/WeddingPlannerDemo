Project Description:

This is a wedding service advertising platform designed to connect engaged couples with trusted vendors for their big day. The platform allows vendors (such as photographers, caterers, decorators, etc.) to create profiles, showcase their services, and advertise to potential clients. Brides, grooms, and customers can browse services, read reviews, view vendor portfolios, and make informed decisions. The system includes features like user registration, vendor subscription payments, service listings, feedback and ratings, and secure profile management.
